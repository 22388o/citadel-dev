# citadel-dev

Automatically initialize and manage a Citadel development environment.

## Install

### Clone with Git

```
git clone https://github.com/runcitadel/citadel-dev.git ~/.citadel-dev
```

### Update Shell Profile

```shell
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.citadel-dev/bin"
```

### Install Vagrant

Run `citadel-setup` if you're on debian/ubuntu based Linux, and you've already completed the above steps. It runs the following:

```
curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-add-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install vagrant
vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
```

### Install dependencies for vagrant-libvirt

Make sure your have all the build dependencies installed for
vagrant-libvirt. This depends on your distro. An overview:

- Ubuntu 18.10, Debian 9 and up:

```shell
apt-get build-dep vagrant ruby-libvirt
apt-get install qemu libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients ebtables dnsmasq-base
apt-get install libxslt-dev libxml2-dev libvirt-dev zlib1g-dev ruby-dev
apt-get install libguestfs-tools
```

- Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 8 and older:

```shell
apt-get build-dep vagrant ruby-libvirt
apt-get install qemu libvirt-bin ebtables dnsmasq-base
apt-get install libxslt-dev libxml2-dev libvirt-dev zlib1g-dev ruby-dev
apt-get install libguestfs-tools
```

(It is possible some users will already have libraries from the third line installed, but this is the way to make it work OOTB.)

- CentOS 6, 7, Fedora 21:

```shell
yum install qemu libvirt libvirt-devel ruby-devel gcc qemu-kvm libguestfs-tools
```

- Fedora 22 and up:

```shell
dnf install -y gcc libvirt libvirt-devel libxml2-devel make ruby-devel libguestfs-tools
```

- OpenSUSE leap 15.1:

```shell
zypper install qemu libvirt libvirt-devel ruby-devel gcc qemu-kvm libguestfs
```

- Arch Linux: please read the related [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Vagrant#vagrant-libvirt) page.

```shell
pacman -S vagrant
```

Now you're ready to install vagrant-libvirt using standard [Vagrant plugin](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/plugins/usage.html) installation methods.

For some distributions you will need to specify `CONFIGURE_ARGS` variable before running `vagrant plugin install`:

- Fedora 32 + upstream Vagrant:
  ```shell
  export CONFIGURE_ARGS="with-libvirt-include=/usr/include/libvirt with-libvirt-lib=/usr/lib64"
  ```

### Install vagrant-libvirt

```shell
vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt
```

### Funding the Lightning wallet

1. Create a wallet with Bitcoin core:

```shell
$ citadel-dev bitcoin-cli createwallet "mywallet"
```

2. Generate some blocks to get funds:

```shell
$ citadel-dev bitcoin-cli -generate 101
```

3. Generate a new address with LND:

```shell
$ citadel-dev lncli -n regtest newaddress p2wkh
```

4. Send some funds to the new address:

```shell
$ citadel-dev bitcoin-cli -named sendtoaddress address="<my-address>" amount=0.5 fee_rate=1 replaceable=true
```

5. Mine some blocks to confirm the transaction:

```shell
$ citadel-dev bitcoin-cli -generate 6
```

6. You should now be able to open channels with other nodes in your network

## Troubleshooting

### Possible problems with vagant-libvert plugin installation on Linux

In case of problems with building nokogiri and ruby-libvirt gem, install
missing development libraries for libxslt, libxml2 and libvirt.

On Ubuntu, Debian, make sure you are running all three of the `apt` commands above with `sudo`.

On RedHat, Centos, Fedora, ...

```shell
$ sudo dnf install libxslt-devel libxml2-devel libvirt-devel ruby-devel gcc
```

On Arch Linux it is recommended to follow [steps from ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Vagrant#vagrant-libvirt).

If have problem with installation - check your linker. It should be `ld.gold`:

```shell
sudo alternatives --set ld /usr/bin/ld.gold
# OR
sudo ln -fs /usr/bin/ld.gold /usr/bin/ld
```

If you have issues building ruby-libvirt, try the following:

```shell
CONFIGURE_ARGS='with-ldflags=-L/opt/vagrant/embedded/lib with-libvirt-include=/usr/include/libvirt with-libvirt-lib=/usr/lib' GEM_HOME=~/.vagrant.d/gems GEM_PATH=$GEM_HOME:/opt/vagrant/embedded/gems PATH=/opt/vagrant/embedded/bin:$PATH vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt
```

### Additional Notes for Fedora and Similar Linux Distributions

If you encounter the following load error when using the vagrant-libvirt plugin (note the required by libssh):

```shell
/opt/vagrant/embedded/lib/ruby/2.4.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:55:in `require': /opt/vagrant/embedded/lib64/libcrypto.so.1.1: version `OPENSSL_1_1_1b' not found (required by /lib64/libssh.so.4) - /home/xxx/.vagrant.d/gems/2.4.6/gems/ruby-libvirt-0.7.1/lib/_libvirt.so (LoadError)
```

then the following steps have been found to resolve the problem. Thanks to James Reynolds (see https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11020#issuecomment-540043472). The specific version of libssh will change over time so references to the rpm in the commands below will need to be adjusted accordingly.

```shell
# Fedora
dnf download --source libssh

# centos 8 stream, doesn't provide source RPMs, so you need to download like so
git clone https://git.centos.org/centos-git-common
# centos-git-common needs its tools in PATH
export PATH=$(readlink -f ./centos-git-common):$PATH
git clone https://git.centos.org/rpms/libssh
cd libssh
git checkout imports/c8s/libssh-0.9.4-1.el8
into_srpm.sh -d c8s
cd SRPMS

# common commands (make sure to adjust verison accordingly)
rpm2cpio libssh-0.9.0-5.fc30.src.rpm | cpio -imdV
tar xf libssh-0.9.0.tar.xz
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../libssh-0.9.0 -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/opt/vagrant/embedded/
make
sudo cp lib/libssh* /opt/vagrant/embedded/lib64
```

If you encounter the following load error when using the vagrant-libvirt plugin (note the required by libk5crypto):

```shell
/opt/vagrant/embedded/lib/ruby/2.4.0/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb:55:in `require': /usr/lib64/libk5crypto.so.3: undefined symbol: EVP_KDF_ctrl, version OPENSSL_1_1_1b - /home/rbelgrave/.vagrant.d/gems/2.4.9/gems/ruby-libvirt-0.7.1/lib/_libvirt.so (LoadError)
```

then the following steps have been found to resolve the problem. After the steps below are complete, then reinstall the vagrant-libvirt plugin without setting the `CONFIGURE_ARGS`. Thanks to Marco Bevc (see https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11020#issuecomment-625801983):

```shell
# Fedora
dnf download --source krb5-libs

# centos 8 stream, doesn't provide source RPMs, so you need to download like so
git clone https://git.centos.org/centos-git-common
# centos-git-common needs its tools in PATH
export PATH=$(readlink -f ./centos-git-common):$PATH
git clone https://git.centos.org/rpms/krb5
cd krb5
git checkout imports/c8s/krb5-1.18.2-8.el8
into_srpm.sh -d c8s
cd SRPMS

# common commands (make sure to adjust verison accordingly)
rpm2cpio krb5-1.18-1.fc32.src.rpm | cpio -imdV
tar xf krb5-1.18.tar.gz
cd krb5-1.18/src
./configure
make
sudo cp -P lib/crypto/libk5crypto.* /opt/vagrant/embedded/lib64/
```
